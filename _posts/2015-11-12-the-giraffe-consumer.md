I'm not the tallest person in the world by any stretch; but, at 6'7" (2m), I have a heck of a time finding sized items that fit me correctly.  Clothes and cars for starters.  Airplane seats, beds, desks, chairs and couches are also on the list.  Obviously, not all of these items are equally impactful.  In fact, it has become more and more alarming to me how much some of these ill fitting items affect my health.  Driving my car for instance, even though I "fit", has become a literal pain in my neck.

I want to do something about this, that can help all tall people.  

The goal of this site is to provide tools to tall people to aid in finding things that fit.   To start, I will focus on assessing the suitability and sizing of cars for tall people.  Yes, I've seen man sites that do this; but, they all fall short of providing adequate information for me.  Also, as I already hinted above, I've not found any that consider some of the more insidious facets of poor fits.
